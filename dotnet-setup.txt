When your download completes, open a terminal and run the following commands to extract the SDK and make the commands available at the terminal.

mkdir -p $HOME/dotnet && tar zxf dotnet-sdk-8.0.201-win-x64.exe -C $HOME/dotnet
export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/dotnet
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/dotnet

The previous commands will only make the .NET SDK commands available for the terminal session in which it was run.

You can edit your shell profile to permanently add the commands. There are several different shells available for Linux and each has a different profile. For example:

Bash Shell: ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc
Korn Shell: ~/.kshrc or .profile
Z Shell: ~/.zshrc or .zprofile

Edit the appropriate source file for your shell and add :$HOME/dotnet to the end of the existing PATH statement. If no PATH statement is included, add a new line with export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/dotnet.

Also add export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/dotnet to the end of the file.
